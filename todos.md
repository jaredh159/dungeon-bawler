# stuff we want to try

- [ ] make monsters move randomley whn they dont see us
- [ ] make so drunkards walk (maybe others) don't hollow tile next to edge
- [ ] it would be cool to let the user pick map architect
- [ ] be able to watch the drunken miners carve out the map
- [âˆš] make it so when colliding with monster, both entities lose points
